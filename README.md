The official code to replicate the results found in ''EUPG: Efficient Unlearning with Privacy Guarantees''.

## Paper 

[EUPG: Efficient Unlearning with Privacy Guarantees]()

## Content
The repository contains one jupyter notebook for each benchmark which can be used to re-produce the experiments reported in the paper for that benchmark. The notebooks contain clear instructions on how to run the experiments. 

## Data sets
The three used datasets (found in the data folder) are publicly available.
[Adult income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult), [Heart disease](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset), and [Credit information](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit).

## Dependencies

[Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

[PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/)
